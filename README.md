subscriptionJS-jquery
==============

a minimal example on how to build a self-service signup page using [subscriptionJS](https://developer.billwerk.io/Docs/subscriptionJS_Introduction) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com).
The example can be executed as it is, because the default configuration contains valid values of our billwerk demo account.
If you already have a billwerk sandbox account you can simply change the settings to match your needs.
